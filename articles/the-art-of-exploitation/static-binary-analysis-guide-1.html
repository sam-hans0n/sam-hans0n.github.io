          What is static binary analysis?
          <p>
            Static binary analysis is the science of decoding the instructions and intentions of any given binary program
            (a file containing a sequence of bytes the CPU will execute, not human readable) without actually executing it.
            Simply by analyzing the diassembeled code a binary contains, we can discover the exact instructions the program executes.
            This reverse engineering process helps us understand exactly what the program is doing at an instruction-level.
            Static analysis can be done through a handful of ways and this article will present the most basic methods.

          Why is static binary analysis important?
          <p>
            Static binary analysis is another tool in the toolbox. Compared to dynamic binary analysis, it is quite time and effort
            intensive. However, dynamic analysis has singificant weaknesses such as not guaranteeing all instructions are executed
            when the program is ran. Static analysis ensures that all code paths are visible.

          Translating x86 to C, an into to static analysis and disassembly
          <p>
              Given an initial binary executable, for example <code>mystery1</code>, we can use <code>objdump</code> to
              extract the instructions.</br>
              <code>objdump -d mystery1</code> </br>
              The object dump command with the -d flag disassembes the code using the <a href="https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/linear-sweep-vs-recursive-disassembling-algorithm/">linear sweep</a> method.
              Output:</br>
