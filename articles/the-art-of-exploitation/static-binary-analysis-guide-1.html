          What is static binary analysis?
          <p>
            JavaScript (JS) engines are the programs which power your web browser. More accurately, they interpret and execute JS code
            in your browsers sandbox. When you browse the Internet, you constantly execute code written by strangers. This would normally
            end in a disaster but the sandbox isolates the browser from the rest of your computer, keeping all the data you
            care about safe.

        <div class="section-header">
          Why is static binary analysis important?
          <p>
            Fuzzing is a classification of software testing techniques that is based on generating permutations of input data
            and feeding them into a program to monitor its behaviour. This technique greatly increases the speed of dynamic binary
            analysis and is often used by researchers and bug hunters to find security flaws in software.

          Our chosen fuzzer
          <p>
            My research group chose a new fuzzing tool called <a href="https://github.com/SoftSec-KAIST/CodeAlchemist">CodeAlchemist</a> to use in our experiments.
            CodeAlchemist requires a set of "seed" JS files. These seeds will be broken down into "code bricks" and reassembled in various ways over
            thousands of interations. These newly created files will be executed by the engine and CodeAlchemist will monitor for any segmentation faults
            thrown by it.
            <br><br>

            CodeAlchemist is semantically aware, meaning the JS code CodeAlchemist produces is all valid and syntactically correct JS. This greatly increases
            our efficiency over other styles of fuzzing.<br><br>
            An example of two code bricks being assembled together to form valid JavaScript code:

            </div>
          </p>
          <p>
            I won't go into details on the internals of CodeAlchemist in this article. More information can be found in the <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ndss2019_05A-5_Han_paper.pdf">original
