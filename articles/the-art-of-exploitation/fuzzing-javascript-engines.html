              <p>
                JavaScript engines are the programs which power your web browser. When you click on a link, you are
                actually just downloading code which renders elements on the screen. JavaScript (JS), the programming language
                that allows for dynamic behavior, is nearly universally used. Since JS is a client-side language, your own
                browser will execute the downloaded code and render the elements that you see on the screen.
              </p>

              <div class="section-header">What is fuzzing?</div>
              <p>
                Fuzzing is a classification of software testing techniques that is based on generating permutations of input data
                which is fed into a program to see how it behaves. This makes the fuzzer do all the hard work, any interesting
                result (e.g. a segmentation fault) will automatically be reported back to you with the respective input.
              </p>

              <div class="section-header">Our chosen fuzzer</div>
              <p>
                We chose a new fuzzing tool called <a href="https://github.com/SoftSec-KAIST/CodeAlchemist">CodeAlchemist</a> to use in our experiments. CodeAlchemist was created for
                JavaScript engines and is semantically aware, meaning the inputs CodeAlchemist provides to the
                engine should always be syntactically correct and therefore greatly increasing our efficiency over other fuzzers.
              </p>
