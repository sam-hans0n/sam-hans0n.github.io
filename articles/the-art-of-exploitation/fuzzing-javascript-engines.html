          What is a JavaScript engine?
          <p>
            JavaScript engines are the programs which power your web browser. When you click on a link, you are
            actually downloading code which renders elements on the screen. JavaScript (JS), the programming language
            that allows for this dynamic behavior, is nearly universally used. Since JS is a client-side language, your own
            browser will interpret and execute the downloaded code via the JavaScript Engine and render the elements that you see on the screen.

          What is fuzzing?
          <p>
            Fuzzing is a classification of software testing techniques that is based on generating permutations of input data
            and feeding them into a program to see how it behaves. This technique greatly increases the speed of dynamic binary
            analysis and is often used by researchers and bug hunters to find flaws in software.

          Our chosen fuzzer
          <p>
            We chose a new fuzzing tool called <a href="https://github.com/SoftSec-KAIST/CodeAlchemist">CodeAlchemist</a> to use in our experiments.
            CodeAlchemist requires a set of "seed" JS files. These seeds will be broken down into "code bricks" and reassembled in various ways over
            thousands of interations. These newly created files will be run against the engine and CodeAlchemist will monitor for any segmentation faults.
            <br><br>

            CodeAlchemist was created specifically for JavaScript engines and is semantically aware, meaning the output CodeAlchemist produces that the
            engine will execute should always be syntactically correct and therefore greatly increasing our efficiency over other fuzzers.<br><br>
            An example:

            <div id="article-pic">
              <img src="../../files/images/codebrick.png"></img>
            </div>
